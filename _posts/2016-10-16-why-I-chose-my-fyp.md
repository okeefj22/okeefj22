I recently completed a six month internship as a full stack Javascript developer
within a large company. Two months into my internship, my team made the decision
to transition to a microservice architecture. At the time, I was involved with
the Continuous Integration team and we were included in the weekly microservices
discussions with the architects. I gained quite a good grasp of microservices
from these meetings and from the following four months while the transition was
beginning to be made. My involvement with the CI team was the first time I had
been exposed to Docker and Iâ€™d like to get some more hands on experience with
containerisation.

This project seems to be the perfect opportunity to learn more about
microservices and containerisation, and working with Seneca will allow me to
improve my Javascript skills.
